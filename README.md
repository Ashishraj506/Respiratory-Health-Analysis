# 🫁 Respiratory Health Analysis

This project analyzes respiratory health data using Python. It focuses on identifying patterns, visualizing trends, and generating insights that can help monitor or predict respiratory issues based on various environmental and health-related parameters.

## 📊 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Visualization of air quality and health indicators
- Correlation analysis between respiratory health and pollutants
- Predictive modeling (if added)
- Report generation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (if ML is used)
- Streamlit/Plotly (if dashboard is used)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.)
- Respiratory health data (cough frequency, breath rate, etc.)
- Demographic info (age, gender, etc.)


## 📌 Future Work

- Include more health parameters (e.g., spirometry data)
- Real-time analysis using IoT sensors
- Web dashboard integration

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to gain meaningful insights into respiratory health. By studying environmental and health-related factors, it helps identify key contributors to respiratory issues and provides a foundation for further research or real-time monitoring systems. With future enhancements, this project can support healthcare professionals and policymakers in making data-driven decisions.
